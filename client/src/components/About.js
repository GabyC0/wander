        <h1>Why Wander?</h1>
        <p>The inspiration behind this website lies behind my passion for exploring the outdoors. Often people think that to travel or to explore means going to another country, maybe spending a lot of money on flights, hotels, transportation, etc. Which could be the case...but doesn't have to be. I'm a strong proponent for affordable travel/exploration and created this with site with the hope that it encourages people to get out there and get going.
